## Project 1 Hello Colour
This project was the first one completed in P5, this has two squares overlaid on top of each other. When you move the mouse on the x-axis it changes the size of the second image, when you move the mouse along the Y-axis it will change the colour of the two squares. This can give some nice simple effects. 

The code for this project broken down can be found [here](https://github.com/kinsella272727/creativeCoding/tree/master/P.1%20Color/Exercise.01-Hello%20Color).
